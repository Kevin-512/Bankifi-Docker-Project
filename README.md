# destiny

This was a project I where I deployed an application to the cloud in Microsoft Azure over the course of a two week internship at Bankifi. This was accomplished in the end through accessing documentation and tutorials made available by Microsoft. I was able to make use of technologies such as Lens, NginX and Docker to manage, deploy and maintain the application which I had encased within a container.
